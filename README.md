# Ionic-Base-Architecture
Integration of i18n &amp; i10n, sass and components with gulp settings.

Few Steps have to follow to get ready - 

<strong>Step 1 </strong>: Run "npm install" and "bower install" in the root folder to get the basic modules( like gulp etc ) and dependencies ( ionic ).

<strong>Step 2 </strong>: Run "ionic setup sass" to get the sass support in the root folder.

<strong>Step 3 </strong>: Navigate to "<root-folder>/www/vendors" and again run "bower install" to get the plugin dependencies( i18n & i10n in this case ) and also all the 3rd party files ( angular modules, jquery plugins ) have to be place in this folder.
